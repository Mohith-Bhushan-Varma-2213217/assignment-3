1. The instructions for this assignment can be found in the PDF, which was the same that has been uploaded on Canvas.
2. There are 2 questions in this assignment, make sure you attempt all the sub questions.
3. First, clone this repository. For your submission, push your working code on Jupyter Notebook (Once you complete the execution, the output should appear below each cell) and the output_images folder(The folder must contain images for each question). Do not bother about output images text file. "In your Virtual Environment, use only OpenCV Library."
4. You should use only the images which are provided in the instructions. Do not use any other images from the internet. Here are the list of images you can find in this repository lena.jpg (for the 1st question), aspens_in_fall.jpg, forest.jpg and mask.jpg (for the 2nd question).
